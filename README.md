# Fast-Kubernetes
This repo covers Kubernetes details (Kubectl, Pod, Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, ReplicaSet, PV, PVC, Secret, Kubeadm, etc.) fastly, and possible example usage scenarios (HowTo: Applications) in a nutshell. Possible usage scenarios are aimed to update over time.

## Prerequisite
- Have a knowledge of Container Technology. You can learn it from here => [Fast-Docker](https://github.com/omerbsezer/Fast-Docker)


**Keywords:** Containerization, Kubernetes, Kubectl, Pod, Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, ReplicaSet, Volume, Cheatsheet.

## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
Why should we use Kubernetes? "Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available." (Ref: Kubernetes.io)

### What is Containerization? What is Container Orchestration? <a name="containerization"></a>
- "Containerization is an operating system-level virtualization or application-level virtualization over multiple network resources so that software applications can run in isolated user spaces called containers in any cloud or non-cloud environment" (wikipedia)
- With Docker Environment, we can create containers.
- Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are the container orchestration and management tools that automate and schedule the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.

### Features <a name="features"></a>
- Service discovery and load balancing: Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.
- Storage orchestration: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more.
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks:  You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. 
- Automatic bin packing: You tell Kubernetes how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs. Kubernetes can fit containers onto your nodes to make the best use of your resources.
- Self-monitoring: Kubernetes checks constantly the health of nodes and containers
- Self-healing: Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check
- Automates various manual processes: for instance, Kubernetes will control for you which server will host the container, how it will be launched etc.
- Interacts with several groups of containers: Kubernetes is able to manage more cluster at the same time
- Provides additional services: as well as the management of containers, Kubernetes offers security, networking and storage services
- Horizontal scaling: Kubernetes allows you scaling resources not only vertically but also horizontally, easily and quickly
- Container balancing: Kubernetes always knows where to place containers, by calculating the “best location” for them
- Run everywhere: Kubernetes is an open source tool and gives you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you move workloads to anywhere you want
- Secret and configuration management: Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information
